# Gitlab CI - intro into Parent-child + Dynamic child pipelines

Repository used for live demo on [PHPLive 2021 conference](https://phplive.cz).

Goal is to demonstrate through the demos, how to get from "classic approach" to parent-child pipelines, with dynamic child pipelines that will trigger based on changed code only for those packages that are affected (and their dependencies). 

## Demo 1

"Classic approach" - monorepo without parent-child pipelines, everything run in the same pipeline.

- [Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/janmikes/phplive-2021-parent-child-pipelines/-/pipelines/380721770)
